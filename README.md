Project Overview

The main source of income for the Australian Government is income tax, which is collected by the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) and applied to the taxable income of individuals. 
Suppose your employer pays your salary on a weekly basis. They will deduct the weekly withholding tax from your salary and send it to the ATO. 
At the end of the financial year, you can lodge a tax return to calculate your tax liability. Often, your employer will have already paid a little too much tax to the ATO, making you eligible for a tax return. 
In this project, we have been asked to address the following questions:

Generate 10 individuals’ weekly salaries using the given distribution.
Calculate their yearly income tax based on the Australian resident tax rates for 2023–24.
Calculate their weekly withholding tax using the withholding tax formula provided by the ATO.
Calculate each individual’s tax return.
Calculate the employer’s weekly before-tax superannuation contribution.
