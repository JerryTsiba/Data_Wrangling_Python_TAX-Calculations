Task Overview\n","\n","The main source of income for the Australian Government is income tax, which is collected by the\n","Australian Taxation Office (ATO) and applied to the taxable income of individuals. Suppose your\n","employer pays your salary on a weekly basis. They will deduct the weekly withholding tax from your\n","salary and send it to the ATO. At the end of the financial year, you can lodge a tax return to calculate\n","your tax liability. Often, your employer will have already paid a little too much tax to the ATO, making\n","you eligible for a tax return.\n","In this exercise, you will be asked to complete the following questions:\n","1. Generate 10 individuals’ weekly salaries using the given distribution.\n","2. Calculate their yearly income tax based on the Australian resident tax rates for 2023–24.\n","3. Calculate their weekly withholding tax using the withholding tax formula provided by the ATO.\n","4. Calculate each individual’s tax return.\n","5. Calculate the employer’s weekly before-tax superannuation contribution.\n","6. Repeat Subtasks 2, 3, 4 to recalculate the income tax, withholding tax, and tax return."],"metadata":{"id":"miiZZ1_R51oi"},"id":"miiZZ1_R51oi"},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"40640179-fa2a-4791-b022-f74a6c2f3c03","metadata":{"id":"40640179-fa2a-4791-b022-f74a6c2f3c03"},"source":["# Question 1:"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"id":"466bab7a-527a-42d5-9ecd-0bb46de9d9a4","metadata":{"id":"466bab7a-527a-42d5-9ecd-0bb46de9d9a4","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1736654766948,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":166,"user":{"displayName":"Jerry Tsiba","userId":"15268809869316966902"}}},"outputs":[],"source":["# import numpy as np\n","import numpy as np"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":2,"id":"27d67ec7-1ec4-48eb-843c-7e6ce97a10a0","metadata":{"id":"27d67ec7-1ec4-48eb-843c-7e6ce97a10a0","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1736654767400,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":270,"user":{"displayName":"Jerry Tsiba","userId":"15268809869316966902"}}},"outputs":[],"source":["weeklySalary = np.random.normal(1431, 527, 10) ##\n","weeklySalary = [round(x, 2) for x in weeklySalary]"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":3,"id":"78f4599b-d70d-4866-8976-a359474485ab","metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"78f4599b-d70d-4866-8976-a359474485ab","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1736654767400,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":9,"user":{"displayName":"Jerry Tsiba","userId":"15268809869316966902"}},"outputId":"49013a4b-b9ab-46cf-c9af-aa60f6a91b45"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["[492.92, 1628.53, 1434.5, 2093.81, 2279.21, 1670.58, 1419.01, 1855.46, 952.07, 2363.02]\n"]}],"source":["## Generated list of weekly before-tax salaries for 10 individuals\n","print(weeklySalary)"]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["#To confirm that it is the weekly salaries of 10 individuals\n","len(weeklySalary)"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"mcESxjFK0Xww","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1736654767400,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":8,"user":{"displayName":"Jerry Tsiba","userId":"15268809869316966902"}},"outputId":"a3db1426-8e2a-4be1-a3dc-8093b6b9dfa0"},"id":"mcESxjFK0Xww","execution_count":4,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["10"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":4}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# Question 2:"],"metadata":{"id":"v_RwMnX70cp7"},"id":"v_RwMnX70cp7"},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Define the tax brackets\n","# In the below TAX_BRACKETS, data are organized such as we have: start, end, base_tax, rate\n","TAX_BRACKETS = [\n","    (0, 18200, 0, 0),\n","    (18201, 45000, 0, 0.19),\n","    (45001, 120000, 5092, 0.325),\n","    (120001, 180000, 29467, 0.37),\n","    (180001, float('inf'), 51667, 0.45)\n","]\n","\n","# Weekly salaries for individuals\n","weeklySalary\n","\n","# Convert weekly salary to annual salary\n","annualSalary = [weekly * 52 for weekly in weeklySalary]\n","\n","# Function to calculate tax for a given annual salary\n","def calculate_tax(income):\n","    for start, end, base_tax, rate in TAX_BRACKETS:\n","        if start <= income <= end:\n","            return base_tax + rate * (income -

The superannuation, which is 11% of the weekly salary, reduces the taxable income, leading to recalculated income tax and withholding tax values. This adjustment ensures compliance with Australian tax regulations that consider superannuation as a deduction from taxable income. The output provides detailed weekly and annual financial summaries for each individual, including adjusted tax liabilities and refunds.\n","\n","Possible extensions of the analysis could include incorporating additional deductions or credits, such as work-related expenses or healthcare offsets, to simulate more realistic scenarios. Additionally, integrating variability in superannuation rates or including the impact of superannuation taxes could further enhance the model's applicability. The current approach is modular, allowing for easy adaptation to such extensions, ensuring robust financial calculations for a broader range of use cases."],"metadata":{"id":"aUc3Y-e183Ti"},"id":"aUc3Y-e183Ti"}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3 (ipykernel)","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.12.7"},"colab":{"provenance":[]}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":5}
